## Part 1: PCA with penguins

```{r}
penguin_pca <- penguins %>% 
  select(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm"))  %>% #shortcut to select columns that end with _mm
  drop_na() %>% 
  scale() %>%  #scale variables 
  prcomp()

penguin_pca$rotation #loadings for different variables in PCA

penguin_complete <- penguins %>% 
  drop_na(body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm"))

#Create a biplot
autoplot(penguin_pca,
         data = penguin_complete,
         colour = 'species',
         loadings = TRUE,
         loadings.label = TRUE) + #shows locations on PC1 and PC2 of all observations in data (axis rotation) 
  theme_minimal()
# almost 69% of variance explained in PC1, and 19% explained in PC2, can also see that Adelie and Chinstrap overlap in multivariance
```
